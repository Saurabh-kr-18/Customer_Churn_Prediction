# Customer_Churn_Prediction
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques on the Telco Customer Churn Dataset. The dataset includes customer demographics, account information, and service usage patterns. Our goal is to identify key drivers of churn and build predictive models that can flag customers at risk of leaving.
